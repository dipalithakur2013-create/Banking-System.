# 💠 Transparent Decentralized On-Chain Banking System

### 🧾 Project Description  
This project is a **Transparent Decentralized On-Chain Banking System**, built to demonstrate how blockchain technology can be used to create a secure, open, and efficient banking model.  
It removes the need for centralized control, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and track their funds directly on the blockchain — with **full transparency** and **no intermediaries**.

---

### ⚙️ What It Does  
- Allows users to **create accounts** on the blockchain.  
- Supports **secure deposits and withdrawals** through smart contracts.  
- Maintains an **immutable transaction record** for full transparency.  
- Ensures **no double-spending or fraud**, thanks to on-chain validation.
